        "Led technical effort to make self-driving simulator adaptable for large scale autonomy-software changes (fundamental restructuring of the robot stack). Architected and implemented solution for 100s of autonomy engineers to test and land new system while building consensus across autonomy, systems engineering, and safety groups on cleanly transitioning to the new simulation modality.",
        "Key Contributor to simulation engine for testing autonomous vehicles. Contributions include: camera simulation and Auto-labeling, automated scenario generation from real world data, actor trajectory editor and associated movement code, and software bridge for interfacing with 2 robotic operating systems.",
        "Acting manager for 6+ person engineering team for 11 weeks (manager on leave). Succesfully supported team through group reorganization. Helped team remain performant through continued fully remote time period. Managed quarterly planning for group.",
        "Tech lead on team providing reliable software solutions that scale to hundreds of thousands of sensor simulations, allowing deep exploration of autonomy behavior across multiple dimensions of scenario parameters (eg: actor position, speed etc.) Managed sprint to sprint planning and execution of multiple engineers.",
